Here's an example of a README file for a GitHub project implementing the 15-puzzle using the IDA* algorithm:

15-Puzzle Solver
This project implements a solver for the 15-puzzle using the Iterative Deepening A* (IDA*) algorithm. The 15-puzzle is a sliding puzzle that consists of a 4x4 grid of numbered tiles with one tile missing. The objective of the puzzle is to move the tiles until they are in numerical order.
